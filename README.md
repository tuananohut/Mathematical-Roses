# Mathematical-Roses

This a rose drawing application. What is a rose? A rose is the set of points in polar coordinates specified by the polar equation.
    
    x = r * cos(k * a)
    y = r * cos(k * b)
    
    k = n/d 

When you run the program you can change the n and d values. You can draw any shape from the picture below. Press n or d to increase their values. n is red, d is blue.

For more information you can check the references.

### How to run it? 
If you have Visual Studio 2022, just download the files and open the solution file. If you don't want have Visual Studio 2022, you can just dowload the debug folder and run the .exe file. But there is a problem about text, I am going to fix that.
